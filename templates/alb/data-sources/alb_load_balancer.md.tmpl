{{ .Description }}


Get information about a Yandex Application Load Balancer. For more information, see [Yandex.Cloud Application Load Balancer](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/application-load-balancer/quickstart).

## Example usage

{{tffile "examples/alb/data-sources/alb_load_balancer_example_1.tf"}}

This data source is used to define [Application Load Balancer](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/application-load-balancer/concepts/application-load-balancer) that can be used by other resources.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `load_balancer_id` - Load Balancer ID.

* `name` - Name of the Load Balancer.

~> **NOTE:** One of `load_balancer_id` or `name` should be specified.

* `folder_id` - Folder that the resource belongs to. If value is omitted, the default provider folder is used.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `description` - An optional description of the Load Balancer.

* `folder_id` - The ID of the folder to which the resource belongs. If omitted, the provider folder is used.

* `labels` - Labels to assign to this Load Balancer. A list of key/value pairs.

* `region_id` - ID of the region that the Load Balancer is located at.

* `network_id` - ID of the network that the Load Balancer is located at.

* `security_group_ids` - A list of ID's of security groups attached to the Load Balancer.

* `allocation_policy` - Allocation zones for the Load Balancer instance. The structure is documented below.

* `listener` - List of listeners for the Load Balancer. The structure is documented below.

* `log_options` - Cloud Logging settings. The structure is documented below.

* `created_at` - The Load Balancer creation timestamp.

* `status` - Status of the Load Balancer.

* `log_group_id` - Cloud log group used by the Load Balancer to store access logs.

---

The `allocation_policy` block supports:
