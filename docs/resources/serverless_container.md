# yandex_serverless_container




Allows management of Yandex Cloud Serverless Containers

## Example usage

```terraform
resource "yandex_serverless_container" "test-container" {
  name               = "some_name"
  description        = "any description"
  memory             = 256
  execution_timeout  = "15s"
  cores              = 1
  core_fraction      = 100
  service_account_id = "are1service2account3id"
  runtime {
    type = "task"
  }
  secrets {
    id                   = yandex_lockbox_secret.secret.id
    version_id           = yandex_lockbox_secret_version.secret_version.id
    key                  = "secret-key"
    environment_variable = "ENV_VARIABLE"
  }
  mounts {
    mount_point_path = "/mount/point"
    ephemeral_disk {
      size_gb = 5
    }
  }
  image {
    url = "cr.yandex/yc/test-image:v1"
  }
  log_options {
    log_group_id = "e2392vo6d1bne2aeq9fr"
    min_level    = "ERROR"
  }
  provision_policy {
    min_instances = 1
  }
}
```

### Serverless Container with Image Digest

```terraform
resource "yandex_serverless_container" "test-container-with-digest" {
  name   = "some_name"
  memory = 128
  image {
    url    = "cr.yandex/yc/test-image:v1"
    digest = "sha256:e1d772fa8795adac847a2420c87d0d2e3d38fb02f168cab8c0b5fe2fb95c47f4"
  }
}
```

### Serverless Container with Mounted Object Storage Bucket

```terraform
locals {
  folder_id = "folder_id"
}

resource "yandex_serverless_container" "test-container-object-storage-mount" {
  name               = "some_name"
  memory             = 128
  service_account_id = yandex_iam_service_account.sa.id
  image {
    url = "cr.yandex/yc/test-image:v1"
  }
  mounts {
    mount_point_path = "/mount/point"
    mode             = "ro"
    object_storage {
      bucket = yandex_storage_bucket.my-bucket.bucket
    }
  }
}

resource "yandex_iam_service_account" "sa" {
  folder_id = local.folder_id
  name      = "test-sa"
}

resource "yandex_resourcemanager_folder_iam_member" "sa-editor" {
  folder_id = local.folder_id
  role      = "storage.editor"
  member    = "serviceAccount:${yandex_iam_service_account.sa.id}"
}

resource "yandex_iam_service_account_static_access_key" "sa-static-key" {
  service_account_id = yandex_iam_service_account.sa.id
  description        = "static access key for object storage"
}

resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "my-bucket" {
  access_key = yandex_iam_service_account_static_access_key.sa-static-key.access_key
  secret_key = yandex_iam_service_account_static_access_key.sa-static-key.secret_key
  bucket     = "bucket"
